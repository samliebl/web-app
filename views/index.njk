    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a way to (among many other things) go back and forth with servers in such a way that it allows parts of a page to <em>update without a full reload.</em> In this application, AJAX is utilized to handle ‚Äúform submissions‚Äù (uploading that file and returning the transcription). When you submit that form (or uploads a file), AJAX shoots it to the server in the background. While nobody‚Äôs looking üòÜ, the page updates dynamically and it‚Äôs just right there!</li>
