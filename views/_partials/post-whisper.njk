<h3>2: A more complex <code>POST</code> request</h3>
<p>This part is a bit more interesting. I'm particularly interested in text-to-speech and speech-to-text work. I've had a lot of fun playing around with <a href="https://openai.com/index/whisper/">Whisper</a> by <a href="https://openai.com">OpenAI</a>. You may know them as the makers of ChatGPT. Whisper is a pretty advanced, at least for the general public, way to build transcription features into applications. You upload a file of someone talking and it transcribes it.</p>
<p>As a personal request, please keep it two minutes or less. I'm paying OpenAI for this myself!</p>
<form id="transcription-form" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <label for="audio">Upload audio of someone talking in one of these formats: <code>.mp3</code>, <code>.wav</code>, <code>.m4a</code>, <code>.ogg</code> or <code>.webm</code>.</label>
    <input type="file" name="audio" accept="audio/*" required />
    <button type="submit">Upload and Transcribe</button>
